Manual Strategy

To run my code, you can just type in python *insert file name here*.py from the command line in the directory, and the code will generate the appropriate graphs and print the statistics for the Optimal Strategy.

You should do this with indicators.py, TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy.py, and ManualStrategy.py.

Thanks!
